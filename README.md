## About

> This project using a starter [boilerplate](https://github.com/bertho-zero/react-redux-universal-hot-example)

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Running Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building and Running Production Server

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

## Demo

A demonstration of this app can be seen [running on heroku](https://simple-blog-react-redux.herokuapp.com/), which is a deployment of the [deploy branch](https://github.com/cyberid41/simple-blog-react/tree/deploy).

## Deployment on Heroku

To get this project to work on Heroku, you need to:

1. Remove the `"PORT": 8080` line from the `betterScripts` / `start-prod` section of `package.json`.
2. `heroku config:set NODE_ENV=production`
3. `heroku config:set NODE_PATH=./src`
4. `heroku config:set NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=false`
  * This is to enable webpack to run the build on deploy.

The first deploy might take a while, but after that your `node_modules` dir should be cached.
